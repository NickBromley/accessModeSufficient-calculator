A simple tool to calculate required values for the 'accessModeSufficient' metadata property for an epub, depending on the type of content it contains.

Simply select the content formant that appears in your epub (text, imags, audio, video), along with any text/media alternatives (alt text, captions, transcripts, audio description), and the relevant combinations of 'accessModeSufficient' values will be listed.
